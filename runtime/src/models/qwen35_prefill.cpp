// Batched prompt prefill for the Qwen3.5 dense-hybrid (Qwythos) model.
//
// forward_token ingests a prompt one token at a time, so every prompt token pays a full
// bandwidth-bound weight reload for each projection (a GEMV). prefill_batched_run() instead runs
// the whole prompt through the layer stack in one pass: the weight-bound Q/K/V/O + dense-SwiGLU-FFN
// projections become tensor-core (cp.async, wmma) GEMMs, the Gated-DeltaNet recurrence runs as a
// single sequential scan over all N tokens, and the full-attention layers fill the paged int8 KV
// cache in the exact layout the decode path reads. It fills the same KV cache and recurrent/conv
// state a forward_token loop would, so a subsequent decode is numerically faithful.
//
// This is its own translation unit — it reaches nothing but the explicit Qwen35PrefillCtx, so it
// shares no code with the decode path (qwen35.cpp keeps Impl private).

    // fills it and the quantizer drains it in the very next launch, and nothing reads it again.
    // Only the FP4 operand (74.8 MB + its scale factors) is what the GEMM needs held. So the
    // conversion runs a SLICE of the output rows at a time -- dequant those rows, quantize those
    // rows into their place in the whole operand -- and the staging shrinks to one slice.
    //
    // 32 MB of staging (768 rows at Muse's 19968-wide FFN) puts the whole conversion at ~113 MB
